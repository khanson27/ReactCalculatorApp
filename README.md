# Introduction
This app was made to create an inbrowser calculator app using React and mui components.
- In order to edit this code you must run npm install in order to install all required dependencies. 
- To run the app in browser type npm start in the terminal.

## How to use
You can either type or press the buttons to interact with the app, this is for ease of use. You need to type or press the relevant number, an operator, another number and equals.

## Assumptions
- When starting this app I made the assumption that the app must have basic functionality of addition, subtraction, multiplication and subtraction. 
- I have also added the ability to create decimals and to clear after a completed calculation. 
- The display also shows the calculation as it occurs, this is slightly different than a typical browser or web calculator, it was a personal preference.
- This app also includes key bindings as the app then can be used by clicking the numbers or typing them. 
- Enter and backspace can both be used to evaluate the calculation and delete respectively.

## Limitations
- I have not included much styling to the app and this is something that I will improve as time goes on, such as making the calculator itself larger, and making the buttons accessible to screen readers. 
- Due to time constraints I did not do wireframing, which would have assisted in my planning of the app as well as future developments. 
- A limitation is that you can only have two parameters at a time, so in future I would implement parenthesis as well as intrinsic BODMAS without parenthesis. 
- The clear functionality also does not allow you to just clear one element but rather clears the entire input, I would add a backspace function to the app and amend the keybindings to reflect this. 
- I would also include a percentage option so that you can work out percentages without converting to decimal. 
- As I do not have a lot of experience with scientific functions, I would like to research and develop a scientific calculator option.
